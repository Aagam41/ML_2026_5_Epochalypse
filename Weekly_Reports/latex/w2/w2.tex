	\section*{Outline of Performed Tasks:}
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
		\item Cloned and set up the BoxMOT repository locally
		\item Resolved dependency and environment configuration issues
		\item Studied BoxMOT codebase structure and tracking pipeline
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section*{Detailed Problem Statement}	
	\paragraph{Motivation:}  
	Most state-of-the-art MOT frameworks (e.g., ByteTrack, DeepSORT, BoT-SORT) rely heavily on deep convolutional neural networks for appearance feature extraction. In UAV footage, objects are:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Small in scale
		\item Subject to rapid camera motion
		\item Frequently occluded
		\item Viewed from top-down perspectives
	\end{itemize}
	
	\paragraph{} This project investigates whether classical feature representations (e.g., HOG, color histograms, contour/shape descriptors) combined with statistical learning methods can provide competitive identity preservation while being computationally lightweight.
	
	\section*{Tentative Tasks for Next Week}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Analyze tracker-specific implementations (ByteTrack, DeepSORT, BoT-SORT) to understand differences in motion and appearance fusion.
		\item Trace the ReID pipeline end-to-end and identify precise integration points for classical feature replacement.
		\item Begin designing and implementing a modular framework to replace deep ReID embeddings with handcrafted classical features.
	\end{enumerate}
